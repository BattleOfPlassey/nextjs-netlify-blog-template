Honestly I never had any problem drawing in front of people. I know many artists for whom that is a big issue, but for me it was always easy. When I was a kid I would often get a little crowd of classmates gathered around watching whenever I started drawing something in study hall or the lunchroom, so maybe I was used to it.
